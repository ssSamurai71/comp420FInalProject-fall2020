This Repository holds my half of the work done for computer science 420, Database theory.
It is a python file that holds political information.
It tells us what years had elections, who won, the people paticipating, and a graph of selected information.
I would change how the inforation is passed into the program since it is parsed by commas.
What I should have done was have them enter the information by seperate fields and then click one of the four "CRUD" buttons.
(CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete)
